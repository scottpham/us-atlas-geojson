Forked from [US-Atlas](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas). Bostock's code was updated to pull 2017 census shapefiles data and then converted into GeoJson.

Documentation on shapefiles [here](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2017/TGRSHP2017_TechDoc.pdf).

Run `make reproduce` to build.
